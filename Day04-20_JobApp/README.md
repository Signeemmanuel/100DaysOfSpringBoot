- **Endpoints Enabled**:
    - `/health`: Monitors the health of the application.
    - `/info`: Displays application information.
    - `/metrics`: Provides various metrics related to the application.
    - `/loggers`: Manages application log levels dynamically.
    - `/beans`: Lists all the beans in the application context.
    - `/shutdown`: Gracefully shuts down the application.

### Docker with Spring Boot
- **Introduction to Docker**: Reviewed Docker architecture and concepts.
- **Installation**: Installed Docker on Windows and Mac.
- **Containerizing Spring Boot Application**: Successfully containerized the job app.
- **Docker Commands**: Practiced essential Docker commands.
