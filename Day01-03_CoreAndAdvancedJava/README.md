## Day 1: Core Java Concepts

### **Learnings:**

Today, I focused on the foundational concepts of Java. Below is a summary of the key topics covered:

1. **Classes and Objects:**
    - Understanding how to define and instantiate classes and objects.
    - Implementing encapsulation and basic object-oriented principles.

2. **Strings:**
    - Working with Java String class methods for manipulation and comparison.
    - Exploring StringBuilder and StringBuffer for mutable strings.

3. **Wrappers:**
    - Using wrapper classes (`Integer`, `Double`, `Character`, etc.) to handle primitive data types.
    - Understanding autoboxing and unboxing.

4. **Arrays:**
    - Declaring, initializing, and accessing arrays.
    - Implementing array manipulation techniques.

5. **Enums:**
    - Defining and using enumerations for a fixed set of constants.
    - Understanding enum methods and their usage.

6. **Expressions:**
    - Creating and evaluating expressions in Java.
    - Understanding operator precedence and expression evaluation.

7. **Control Flow:**
    - Implementing control flow statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, `do-while`).
    - Understanding branching and looping constructs.

8. **Simple Input and Output:**
    - Handling basic input and output using `Scanner` and `System.out`.
    - Implementing file I/O operations.

9. **Packages and Imports:**
    - Organizing classes into packages.
    - Using `import` statements to include classes from other packages.

10. **Software Development:**
    - **Design:** Planning and designing the software structure.
    - **Coding:** Writing code to implement the design.
    - **Testing:** Creating and running tests to verify functionality.
    - **Debugging:** Identifying and fixing issues in the code.

### **Code Examples and Exercises:**

- The `src` folder contains sample code demonstrating the above concepts.
