## Day 1: Core Java Concepts

### **Learnings:**

Today, I focused on the foundational concepts of Java. Below is a summary of the key topics covered:

1. **Classes and Objects:**
    - Understanding how to define and instantiate classes and objects.
    - Implementing encapsulation and basic object-oriented principles.

2. **Strings:**
    - Working with Java String class methods for manipulation and comparison.
    - Exploring StringBuilder and StringBuffer for mutable strings.

3. **Wrappers:**
    - Using wrapper classes (`Integer`, `Double`, `Character`, etc.) to handle primitive data types.
    - Understanding autoboxing and unboxing.

4. **Arrays:**
    - Declaring, initializing, and accessing arrays.
    - Implementing array manipulation techniques.

5. **Enums:**
    - Defining and using enumerations for a fixed set of constants.
    - Understanding enum methods and their usage.

6. **Expressions:**
    - Creating and evaluating expressions in Java.
    - Understanding operator precedence and expression evaluation.

7. **Control Flow:**
    - Implementing control flow statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, `do-while`).
    - Understanding branching and looping constructs.

8. **Simple Input and Output:**
    - Handling basic input and output using `Scanner` and `System.out`.
    - Implementing file I/O operations.

9. **Packages and Imports:**
    - Organizing classes into packages.
    - Using `import` statements to include classes from other packages.

10. **Software Development:**
    - **Design:** Planning and designing the software structure.
    - **Coding:** Writing code to implement the design.
    - **Testing:** Creating and running tests to verify functionality.
    - **Debugging:** Identifying and fixing issues in the code.


### **Project: CreditCard Program**

In addition to learning the above concepts, I also created a simple `CreditCard` program that demonstrates the use of classes, encapsulation, and basic operations. Here's a brief summary of what the program does:

- **Customer Information**: Stores the customer's name, bank name, account number, credit limit, and balance.
- **Operations**:
   - `charge(int price)`: Charges a specified amount to the credit card if it doesn't exceed the limit.
   - `makePayment(double amount)`: Makes a payment to reduce the balance.
- **Utility Method**:
   - `printSummary(CreditCard card)`: Prints the credit card details including customer name, bank name, account number, balance, and limit.

### **Next Steps:**

I will continue to build on these concepts and apply them in upcoming projects. Stay tuned for updates as I dive deeper into Java and Spring Boot!
