Java includes support for writing generic classes and methods that can operate on a
variety of data types while often avoiding the need for explicit casts. The generics
framework allows us to define a class in terms of a set of formal type parameters,
which can then be used as the declared type for variables, parameters, and return
values within the class definition. Those formal type parameters are later specified
when using the generic class as a type elsewhere in a program.
